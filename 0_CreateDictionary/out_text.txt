Henu MehtaniForeword

The National Curriculum Framework, 2005, recommends that children’s life at
school must be linked to their life outside the school. This principle marks a
departure from the legacy of bookish learning which continues to shape our
system and causes a gap between the school, home and community. The
syllabi and textbooks developed on the basis of NCF signify an attempt to
implement this basic idea. They also attempt to discourage rote learning and
the maintenance of sharp boundaries between different subject areas. We hope
these measures will take us significantly further in the direction of a childcentred system of education outlined in the National Policy on Education
(1986).

The success of this effort depends on the steps that school principals and
teachers will take to encourage children to reflect on their own learning and to
pursue imaginative activities and questions. We must recognise that given
space, time and freedom, children generate new knowledge by engaging with
the information passed on to them by adults. Treating the prescribed textbook
as the sole basis of examination is one of the key reasons why other resources
and sites of learning are ignored. Inculcating creativity and initiative is possible
if we perceive and treat children as participants in learning, not as receivers ofa
fixed body of knowledge.

These aims imply considerable change in school routines and mode of
functioning. Flexibility in the daily time-table is as necessary as rigour in
implementing the annual calendar so that the required number of teaching
days are actually devoted to teaching. The methods used for teaching and
evaluation will also determine how effective this textbook proves for making
children’s life at school a happy experience, rather than a source of stress or
boredom. Syllabus designers have tried to address the problem of curricular
burden by restructuring and reorienting knowledge at different stages with
greater consideration for child psychology and the time available for teaching.
The textbook attempts to enhance this endeavour by giving higher priority and
space to opportunities for contemplation and wondering, discussion in small
groups, and activities requiring hands-on experience.

NCERT appreciates the hard work done by the textbook development
committee responsible for this book. We wish to thank the Chairperson of the
advisory group at primary level, Professor Anita Rampal and the Chief Advisor
for this book, Professor R. Lalitha Eapen (CIEFL, Hyderabad) for guiding the
work of this committee. Several teachers contributed to the development of this
textbook; we are grateful to their principals for making this possible. We are
indebted to the institutions and organisations which have generously

2019-2020permitted us to draw upon their resources, material and personnel. We are
especially grateful to the members of the National Monitoring Committee,
appointed by the Department of Secondary and Higher Education, Ministry of
Human Resource Development under the Chairpersonship of Professor Mrinal
Miri and Professor G.P. Deshpande, for their valuable time and contribution. As
an organisation committed to the systemic reform and continuous
improvement in the quality of its products, NCERT welcomes comments and
suggestions which will enable us to undertake further revision and refinement.

Gonu lived in a house of bricks.

 

 

 

 

 

One day a big bad wolf came to Sonu’s house.
He said, “I will huff and puff and I will blow your
house down.” So he huffed and he ¢*%

The emphasis in this book is on developing language skills by using the
mother tongue in the initial stages. The teacher’s encouragement and
motivation are very important. Children are curious and love to try things in
their own little ways. Do not correct their mistakes. Focus on the process of
learning and remember that the child needs to be given activities that are
exciting and stimulating.

The first Unit is about introducing the child to a process of learning
following the concept ‘from near to far’. Allow them to talk and help them to
express their thoughts by use of their mother tongue, visuals, pictures,
sketches, single word questions and answers. As you introduce the text
(both the poem and the story), encourage all the children to participate.

>» Develop listening skills
Read the poem /story aloud to the children.

Read it with emphasis on clear speech and correct pauses at commas
and full stops.

>» Develop pronunciation
Let the children read aloud after you. Make them repeat

blow, flow, glow brick, kick, stick huff, puff, stuff

» Exposure to language

Use sight words in the classroom by putting visuals and cue cards.
Let children read these:

=
ae ais ae

>» Develop speaking skills
1. Encourage children to walk and jump like different animals.
Let them make the sounds of ‘huff, ‘puff’ etc. with force.
2. Write two-letter words on the blackboard such as am, he, in, is, it,
me, my, so and start a contextual conversation by saying, ‘She isa

girl’, Tama teacher’, ‘Please give me a pencil’, ‘He is a boy’, ‘You are
so far away’, ‘Itis awarm/cold day’ etc.

Provide opportunities to children for working and playing together in

 

2019-2020small groups. It will promote interaction, togetherness and team spirit
besides encouragement for natural expressions.

3. Conversation based on ‘Role play’
e Divide your class into four groups: Gor. Vata. rBlue} rn
e Leteach group make a house.

Red—ahut Blue—a/flat Yellow— abungalow Green—
an igloo

Red and Blue groups have to talk about all the objects in their
houses.

Yellow and Green groups have to
talk about objects around their MATERIAL REQUIRED
houses. —>—_

e Method— Each group uses low- Boxes/old cartons

cost waste material (€.g.| for collecting leaves, twigs...
newspapers, cardboard, grass,

leaves, matchsticks, etc.) to
draw, sketch, construct or act
out ascene from their house.

Pencils / spoons, beads,
string etc.

 

>» Develop writing skills / fine motor coordination

Writing needs practice before it becomes spontaneous and neat. In
making the strokes show the child how to hold the pencil and use it
safely. Encourage children to make different patterns/basic strokes by
drawing them on the blackboard, slate/paper. Put two letter and three
letter words on flash cards and show them to the children. Let them
recognise the words.

» Raising awareness
Talk about turning off taps and not wasting water.

vocabulary and speech patterns. In Unit 2, involve all the children in these
joyful interactive sessions. Encourage them with phrases such as, “Please
try”, or “Oh! You are so good!” Appreciate every child's efforts and ensure a
feeling of success for all the children. Consider the abilities of each child.

This unit is a good opportunity for involving children in interesting activities
about their environment. Encourage children to look and listen attentively
and express their thoughts freely.

e Talk to them about trees around and how important they are.

e Share with them topics like “Why do you think trees are important
for us?”

Give them clues like, “They give us shade, flowers, fruits etc.”

> Group Activity

Let the children make a class tree MATERIAL REQUIRED
with their handprints. Let them stick ——_+—_——_

> Develop speaking skills

Give children a week or two to learn a rhyme, one in their language and
one in English. Let them recite these. Always appreciate their efforts. Do
not push children who are not ready for it. As facilitators we must let
children speak at their own pace.

 

2019-2020>» Develop writing skills

Write the letters from r to z on the blackboard. Let the children read
from the board and the picture dictionary. Encourage these early writing

attempts and ensure a feeling of success for all children. Use Activity

Sheets and a notebook to further encourage the patterns as on pages
65, 66, 69, 70, 71, 72 and 74.

> Use the method of developing fine motor coordination

Tell the class how to sort out three mixed pulses into different piles or
sort leaves on the basis of their colour, shape and texture.

» Awareness raising

Have a discussion on the hazards of throwing things into the river and
why we must stop this from happening.

Sundari was a big red,

When Bobby made her

she smiled at him.
“You are beautiful and I

will call you Sundari,” he

said.
One day, Bobby took

Sundari to the fair. |
The band was playing and everyone was smiling.
A merry-go-round was playing a happy little tune. It

was carrying lots of boys and girls round and round on

its wooden animals.
Bobby looked for an open space where he could run

and fly his kite. Sundari looked too.
Out in the grass ran Bobby, holding up his kite as high

as he could.

 

 

Puff! The wind
came along.
Sundari started
to fly up! But she
could not go very
high. A little dog
was holding on
to her long tail.
It was in his
mouth.

 

 

 

 

2019-2020Bobby shooed the dog away.

“We'll try again,” Bobby said.

This time Sundari leaped up in the air. She tugged
hard. Oh, how she wanted Bobby to let go of her string!

She gave a big tug. Bobby had to let her go.
“Wheee!” cried Sundari. “Now I can fly as high as I

please!”

In this unit we introduce children to sounds like blow, whoosh, puff, whiff;
dizzy, shooed, shoo, woof, and woo. Encourage children to listen to all the
sounds on their way to school. Let them discuss the ones that were pleasant
and those that were not. You can also ask them to recite different rhymes
involving animal sounds.

Let all children clap their hands and say this entire rhyme once again.

Through play, children develop the habit of establishing and following
instructions which will help them throughout their lives. Playing in
groups helps them to exercise self control. It also gives an opportunity to
the teacher to observe and improve children’s social understanding and
attitudes.

Observation of objects and things around them.
Conversation about the observation they have had.
Sharing of their own view point about the observation.

Reading the text as much as they can, especially the new words.
Encourage the children to say dialogues in their own words; then
write the English words on the blackboard. Have a reading session of
any story from the Unit. Let each child be given a few lines to read.
Engage them in reading aloud with you.

e Writing simple words of one, two, three syllables (a syllable has one
vowel sound, e.g. mug, truck, more (one syllable); never, lazy (two
syllables) and September, October (three syllables).

e Craft making skills such as simple folding, sticking and decorating
the classroom.

>» Use the method of developing skills in a very informal yet clear
manner. The following should be kept in mind:

e Development of listening skills — What the child hears is
important.

e Development of visual skills — What the child sees is important.

e Development of sharing skills — What the child feels is
important.

e Development of speaking skills — How the child is asked to
speak is important.

e Development of reading skills — How the child is exposed to
routine reading is important.

e Development of fine motor skills — Child’s exposure to prewriting activities is important.

e Development of writing skills — This should be the last
milestone in the chain.

. 3} Teacher's Page 9

 

The idea in this Unit is to assist the children in building their imagination;
making and speaking simple sentences; and writing at least a few sentences.

The sentences can be made both from the text and from their environment,
using the sight words and flash cards in their classroom or outdoors.
>» Develop reading skills

Let the children do the activity of odd one out. Encourage them to spot
the one that is different. For example, draw a sequence of objects such as
flowers and make one flower slightly different. Ask the children to point
out the one that is different. These kinds of activities are relevant to
reading as they help them identify and discriminate between objects and
pictures.

Alphabet cards can be used for the matching exercise. The teacher

makes cards from a to z in capitals and in lower case. The child has to
match the capital letter with the corresponding one in lower case. For

example, A with aand Bwith b.
> Group activity
Make a calender for every month showing birthdays of every child and
display it along with this traditional song:
Thirty days hath September,
April, June, and November,
All the rest have thirty-one,
Excepting February alone.
> Develop pronunciation
Have a recitation or reading session of the poem ‘Clouds’. Let each child
be given a chance to read. The more confident he feels, the more
motivated he will be to continue in his efforts.
Have a reading session of the story ‘Anandi’s Rainbow’ from the Unit.
Let each child be given a few lines to read.
>» Develop speaking skills
Discuss with them the following questions
How many days has September?
Does February have 30 days in the month?
How many months have thirty days?
How many months have thirty-one days?
When is your birthday?
How many children in the class have a birthday in each month?

Ask the class to repeat sentences like: ‘It’s cold’, ‘It’s raining today’,
Tt’s hot’, ‘The wind is blowing’, ‘Leaves are falling’.

Poem — Flying-Man
Story — The Tailor and his Friend

>» The emphasis in this Unit is on:
e different occupations;
e imaginative thinking and
e the ability to write and speak sentences.
Children should be able to write sentences such as ‘My nameis...’
There can be times when the children do not speak correctly.
Remember, the main focus is on communication and the ability of the
children to express their feelings in English.

>» Children can be given a series of oral directions to listen to and then
follow. Gradually increase the number of directions. For example:

Pat your head,
touch your nose,
pull your ear,
stamp your feet.

» Encourage an independent reading and writing habit in children and
provide them time for it. Motivate them by reading interesting stories and
poems. Use the language for instruction that is familiar to the child. Let
your enthusiasm for the story shine through. Speak slowly and clearly.

> Some thoughts on friendship, basic hygiene, and compassion for
animals, peace and sensitivity to their environment can be discussed.

» Ask the children to practice the alphabets in lower case and capital
letters. By now the child should have an understanding of basic
punctuation like capital letters, full stops and question marks and be able
to recognise plural and singular forms. In all this, the key word is
encouragement. The child who senses your faith in his abilities will learn
to trust himself and derive satisfaction from his accomplishments and
stay motivated.

> Role play and activities are vital for the development of the child.
Through these he/she learns to communicate verbally, share, take turns
and enjoy interaction with others.

>» This book attempts to involve the child in a sense of joy for a new
language. The child who is gently nurtured, subtly led and exposed to all
aspects of his environment is the child who will learn.
